# PointerSwap

## Project Objective
The **PointerSwap** project demonstrates the use of pointers in C++ to swap the values of two variables without directly modifying their memory addresses. It serves as an educational example for understanding pointer manipulation and memory management in C++.

## Features
- **Pointer Usage**: Demonstrates how to use pointers to access and manipulate variable values indirectly.
- **Value Swapping**: Swaps the values of two integer variables using a temporary pointer.
- **Console Output**: Displays the values of the variables before and after the swap operation.

## Code Overview
1. **Variable Initialization**: Two integer variables, `var1` and `var2`, are initialized with predefined values.
2. **Pointer Declaration**:
   - `ptr1` points to `var1`.
   - `ptr2` points to `var2`.
   - A temporary pointer, `ptr_temp`, is used for the swap.
3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The values of `var1` and `var2` are swapped using pointers and a temporary variable, without modifying their memory addresses directly.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
