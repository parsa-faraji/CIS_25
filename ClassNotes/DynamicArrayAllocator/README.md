## Project Objective
The **DynamicArrayAllocator** is a simple C++ program designed to demonstrate dynamic memory allocation for arrays. The program allows users to input numbers into a dynamically allocated array, calculates the sum of the entered numbers, and returns the result.

## Features
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Uses `new` to dynamically allocate memory for an array at runtime.
- **Flexible Input**: Allows users to enter an arbitrary number of integers until they choose to stop by entering invalid input (e.g., a string or non-integer value).
- **Sum Calculation**: Computes and returns the sum of all the integers entered by the user.

## Code Overview
1. **Array Declaration**: Dynamically allocates memory for an integer array.
2. **Input Handling**: Continuously accepts integers from the user until invalid input is detected.
3. **Sum Calculation**: Iterates through the array to compute the sum of all integers.
4. **Dynamic Memory Management**: Demonstrates the use of dynamic memory allocation with `new`.
